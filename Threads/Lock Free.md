## lock-free
Lock-free data structures in Rust provide thread-safe access and modification without the need for traditional locking mechanisms like mutexes. These structures are designed to reduce contention and improve performance in multi-threaded environments.

Here are some common lock-free, thread-safe data structures in Rust:

### 1. `crossbeam` crate

The `crossbeam` crate provides several lock-free data structures that are thread-safe and efficient.

#### `SegQueue` (Segmented Queue)

A thread-safe, lock-free queue that is suitable for use in multi-producer, multi-consumer scenarios.

```rust
use crossbeam::queue::SegQueue;
use std::sync::Arc;
use std::thread;

fn main() {
    let queue = Arc::new(SegQueue::new());
    let mut handles = vec![];

    for i in 0..10 {
        let queue = Arc::clone(&queue);
        let handle = thread::spawn(move || {
            queue.push(i);
        });
        handles.push(handle);
    }

    for handle in handles {
        handle.join().unwrap();
    }

    while let Some(val) = queue.pop() {
        println!("{}", val);
    }
}
```

### 2. `lockfree` crate

The `lockfree` crate provides a set of lock-free data structures for Rust.

#### `Stack` (Lock-Free Stack)

A lock-free, thread-safe stack.

```rust
use lockfree::stack::Stack;
use std::sync::Arc;
use std::thread;

fn main() {
    let stack = Arc::new(Stack::new());
    let mut handles = vec![];

    for i in 0..10 {
        let stack = Arc::clone(&stack);
        let handle = thread::spawn(move || {
            stack.push(i);
        });
        handles.push(handle);
    }

    for handle in handles {
        handle.join().unwrap();
    }

    while let Some(val) = stack.pop() {
        println!("{}", val);
    }
}
```

### 3. `flurry` crate

The `flurry` crate provides a concurrent, lock-free hash map. It is based on Java's `ConcurrentHashMap`.

#### `HashMap`

A lock-free, thread-safe hash map.

```rust
use flurry::HashMap;
use std::sync::Arc;
use std::thread;

fn main() {
    let map = Arc::new(HashMap::new());
    let mut handles = vec![];

    for i in 0..10 {
        let map = Arc::clone(&map);
        let handle = thread::spawn(move || {
            map.pin().insert(i, i * 10);
        });
        handles.push(handle);
    }

    for handle in handles {
        handle.join().unwrap();
    }

    let guard = map.guard();
    for (key, value) in map.iter(&guard) {
        println!("{}: {}", key, value);
    }
}
```

### 4. `concurrent_queue` crate

The `concurrent_queue` crate provides a lock-free, thread-safe queue.

#### `ConcurrentQueue`

A lock-free, thread-safe queue.

```rust
use concurrent_queue::ConcurrentQueue;
use std::sync::Arc;
use std::thread;

fn main() {
    let queue = Arc::new(ConcurrentQueue::unbounded());
    let mut handles = vec![];

    for i in 0..10 {
        let queue = Arc::clone(&queue);
        let handle = thread::spawn(move || {
            queue.push(i).unwrap();
        });
        handles.push(handle);
    }

    for handle in handles {
        handle.join().unwrap();
    }

    while let Ok(val) = queue.pop() {
        println!("{}", val);
    }
}
```

### Summary

These examples demonstrate how to use various lock-free, thread-safe data structures in Rust. These structures are designed to improve performance and reduce contention in multi-threaded applications by avoiding traditional locking mechanisms.

- `SegQueue` from the `crossbeam` crate
- `Stack` from the `lockfree` crate
- `HashMap` from the `flurry` crate
- `ConcurrentQueue` from the `concurrent_queue` crate
