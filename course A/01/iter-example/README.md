#### Rust's Iterator Pattern

-   **Powerful Features**: Rust offers first-class support for iterators, allowing any type to implement the `Iterator` trait by defining the `next` method.
-   **Zero-Cost Abstraction**: Iterators in Rust do not incur additional runtime overhead.
-   **Standard Library Methods**: Provides methods like `map`, `for_each`, and `fold`.

#### `itertools` Crate

-   **Extended Functionality**: Adds extra iterator adapters, methods, functions, and macros not found in the standard library.
-   **Example Project**: Parsing and processing Apache log files to merge, deduplicate, and sort log entries.

#### Example Steps

1.  **Set Up Project**: Define modules for file handling and log entry representation.
2.  **Read Log Files**: Use `filter_map` to convert lines into `ApacheLogEntry` structs, filtering out errors.
3.  **Merge Iterators**: Use `itertools` to merge, deduplicate, and sort entries:
    -   Import `itertools` and the trait to extend iterator functionality.
    -   Use `merge`, `unique`, and `sorted` methods.
4.  **Collect and Print**: Convert the iterator to a vector and print the sorted log entries.

#### Benefits

-   **Enhanced Iterators**: `itertools` provides methods like `interleave`, `permutations`, and `map_into`, greatly expanding the capability of Rust's iterators.
