## Summary of the Rayon Data Parallelism Library in Rust

**Introduction:** Rayon is a data parallelism library for Rust, designed to easily add parallelism to sequential code. It is lightweight and guarantees data race freedom.

**Overview:**

-   **Rayon's API**: Rayon offers both low-level and high-level APIs.
    -   **Low-Level API**: The `join` function, which takes two closures and runs them potentially in parallel.
    -   **High-Level API**: The `ParallelIterator` trait, a parallel version of the standard library's `Iterator` trait.

**Example Usage:**

1.  **Function Parallelization**:
    
    -   A function `number_of_adults` filters a vector of people to count those over 18 years old.
    -   Originally, this function operates serially.
    -   By importing the Rayon prelude and changing the iterator to `par_iter`, the operation is parallelized.
2.  **Benchmarking**:
    
    -   Two versions of the function are benchmarked: one with Rayon and one without.
    -   Initial results show the Rayon version is slower due to simple filter logic and a relatively small vector.
    -   By increasing the vector size to 2 million, the Rayon version performs better.

**Rayon's Internal Mechanism:**

-   Rayon uses a thread pool and an async runtime with a technique called work stealing to enhance efficiency.
-   **Potential Parallelism**:
    -   Functions like `join` and `par_iter` may run serially or in parallel based on runtime conditions.
    -   This method removes the burden from users to decide when to parallelize, as Rayon handles it based on available resources.

**Pros and Cons:**

-   **Advantages**:
    -   Simplifies adding parallelism.
    -   Effective for divide-and-conquer algorithms and sequential algorithms that can benefit from parallelism.
-   **Disadvantages**:
    -   Restrictions on using channels within closures passed to `join`, as it can lead to deadlocks.
    -   Users can still use mutexes and atomic types for thread-safe operations.

**Customization:**

-   Users can create custom thread pools and specify the number of threads.
