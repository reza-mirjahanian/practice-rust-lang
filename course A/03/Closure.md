Closures are anonymous functions that can capture values from their environment. They are defined using the `||` syntax and can take input parameters and return a value. Closures can be stored in variables, passed as arguments to functions, and returned from functions.

Here's an example of a simple closure that takes an integer as input and returns a boolean:

```rust
let is_even = |x: i32| x % 2 == 0;
```

In this example, `is_even` is a variable that stores a closure that takes an integer `x` as input and returns `true` if `x` is even and `false` otherwise.

Closures can capture values from their environment in three ways:

1. By taking ownership of the values, using the `move` keyword.
2. By borrowing the values immutably.
3. By borrowing the values mutably.

Here's an example that demonstrates capturing values by borrowing immutably:

```rust
let x = 4;
let equal_to_x = |z| z == x;
assert!(equal_to_x(4));
```

In this example, the closure `equal_to_x` captures the value of `x` from its environment and compares it to the input parameter `z`.

Closures are implemented using traits, and Rust provides three traits for closures: `Fn`, `FnMut`, and `FnOnce`. The `Fn` trait represents closures that can be called multiple times and don't capture any values by mutable reference. The `FnMut` trait represents closures that can be called multiple times and may capture values by mutable reference. The `FnOnce` trait represents closures that can be called once and may capture values by ownership.

Rust infers which trait to use for a closure based on how the closure captures values from its environment. If a closure captures values by mutable reference, it will implement `FnMut`. If a closure captures values by ownership, it will implement `FnOnce`. If a closure doesn't capture any values, it will implement `Fn`.

Closures can be used to create more concise and expressive code, and they are commonly used with iterators and higher-order functions.
