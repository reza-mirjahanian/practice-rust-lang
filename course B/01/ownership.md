### Ownership 

### Basic Concepts

1. **Ownership Rules:**
   - Each value in Rust has a single owner.
   - When the owner goes out of scope, the value is dropped.
   - Values can be moved between owners.

2. **Borrowing:**
   - You can borrow a value by creating references.
   - Immutable borrows (`&T`) allow multiple reads.
   - Mutable borrows (`&mut T`) allow a single write.

3. **Lifetimes:**
   - Lifetimes ensure that references are valid as long as necessary.
   - They prevent dangling references by enforcing scope rules.

### Tips and Tricks

#### Understanding Ownership Transfers

- **Move Semantics:**
  ```rust
  let s1 = String::from("hello");
  let s2 = s1; // s1 is moved to s2, s1 is no longer valid
  // println!("{}", s1); // This would cause a compile-time error
  ```
  - The value of `s1` is moved to `s2`. After the move, `s1` cannot be used.

- **Clone for Deep Copies:**
  ```rust
  let s1 = String::from("hello");
  let s2 = s1.clone(); // s1 is still valid
  println!("{}, {}", s1, s2);
  ```

#### Borrowing and References

- **Immutable Borrowing:**
  ```rust
  let s = String::from("hello");
  let len = calculate_length(&s);
  println!("The length of '{}' is {}.", s, len);

  fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize {
      s.len()
  }
  ```

- **Mutable Borrowing:**
  ```rust
  let mut s = String::from("hello");
  change(&mut s);
  println!("{}", s);

  fn change(some_string: &mut String) {
      some_string.push_str(", world");
  }
  ```

- **Borrowing Rules:**
  - Only one mutable reference or multiple immutable references.
  - Mutable references are exclusive.

#### Lifetimes

- **Basic Lifetime Annotations:**
  ```rust
  fn longest<'a>(x: &'a str, y: &'a str) -> &'a str {
      if x.len() > y.len() {
          x
      } else {
          y
      }
  }
  ```

- **Structs with Lifetimes:**
  ```rust
  struct ImportantExcerpt<'a> {
      part: &'a str,
  }

  fn main() {
      let novel = String::from("Call me Ishmael. Some years ago...");
      let first_sentence = novel.split('.').next().expect("Could not find a '.'");
      let i = ImportantExcerpt { part: first_sentence };
  }
  ```

### Practical Examples

#### Working with Collections

- **Vectors and Ownership:**
  ```rust
  let v = vec![1, 2, 3];
  for i in &v {
      println!("{}", i);
  } // v can still be used here
  ```

- **Passing Ownership to Functions:**
  ```rust
  fn take_ownership(some_string: String) {
      println!("{}", some_string);
  }

  let s = String::from("hello");
  take_ownership(s); // s is moved to the function
  // s cannot be used here
  ```

- **Returning Ownership from Functions:**
  ```rust
  fn return_ownership() -> String {
      let some_string = String::from("hello");
      some_string
  }

  let s = return_ownership();
  println!("{}", s); // s owns the returned string
  ```

#### Concurrency with Ownership

- **Shared State in Concurrency:**
  ```rust
  use std::sync::{Arc, Mutex};
  use std::thread;

  let counter = Arc::new(Mutex::new(0));
  let mut handles = vec![];

  for _ in 0..10 {
      let counter = Arc::clone(&counter);
      let handle = thread::spawn(move || {
          let mut num = counter.lock().unwrap();
          *num += 1;
      });
      handles.push(handle);
  }

  for handle in handles {
      handle.join().unwrap();
  }

  println!("Result: {}", *counter.lock().unwrap());
  ```

### Common Pitfalls

- **Dangling References:**
  - Lifetimes prevent dangling references by ensuring references are valid.
  ```rust
  // This will not compile
  fn dangle() -> &String {
      let s = String::from("hello");
      &s // s goes out of scope, and reference is invalid
  }
  ```

- **Mutable and Immutable References:**
  ```rust
  let mut s = String::from("hello");
  let r1 = &s; // no problem
  let r2 = &s; // no problem
  // let r3 = &mut s; // ERROR: cannot borrow `s` as mutable because it is also borrowed as immutable
  println!("{}, {}", r1, r2);
  ```

### Best Practices

- **Minimize Lifetime Annotations:**
  - Rust’s compiler can often infer lifetimes, so only add annotations when necessary.

- **Prefer Immutable References:**
  - Use immutable references when possible to avoid issues with mutability and aliasing.

- **Use RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization):**
  - Leverage Rust’s drop semantics to manage resources cleanly and avoid manual cleanup.

- **Rustacean Principles:**
  - Embrace Rust's strict rules to write safer and more efficient code. Think in terms of ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes.
------------------------
1.  **Understanding Ownership Basics**:
    
    -   **Assignment and Ownership**: When you assign a value to a variable, that variable becomes the sole owner of the value. This tight coupling between assignment and ownership is fundamental to Rust's safety guarantees.
    -   **Single Ownership**: There can only be one owner of a value at a time. When the owner goes out of scope, the value is dropped.
    
2.  **Primitive Types vs. Complex Types**:
    
    -   **Primitive Types**: These are stored on the stack and are copied when assigned. They have a `Copy` trait that enables this behavior.
    -   **Complex Types**: These are stored on the heap and are moved when assigned. They do not have a `Copy` trait and must implement a `drop` function for explicit deallocation.
    
3.  **Borrowing and References**:
    
    -   **Immutable References**: Use `&` to borrow a value without taking ownership. This allows multiple references to the same value, but none can be mutable.
    -   **Mutable References**: Use `&mut` to borrow a value mutably. This allows a single mutable reference to the value, preventing aliasing and ensuring thread safety.
    -   **Lifetime Parameters**: Use `'` followed by a letter to specify the scope of a borrowed reference. This ensures that the reference does not outlive the underlying value.
    
4.  **Reassignment and Moves**:
    
    -   **Moves**: When you reassign a value, ownership is transferred to the new variable. The original variable can no longer be used.
    -   **Cloning**: Use `clone` to create a new copy of a value, which can be useful when you need to keep the original value and create a new one.
    
5.  **Interior Mutability**:
    
    -   **RefCell and Rc**: Use `RefCell` and `Rc` to achieve both shared ownership and mutability. This is useful when you need to mutate a value while still allowing multiple references to it.
    
---------------------
**Use `` `Box` `` to deal with recursive ownership:**


```rust
struct List {
    value: i32,
    next: Option<Box<List>>,
}

fn main() {
    let list = List {
        value: 1,
        next: Some(Box::new(List {
            value: 2,
            next: Some(Box::new(List {
                value: 3,
                next: None,
            })),
        })),
    };
}
```

**6. Use `` `Rc` `` and `` `Arc` `` for shared ownership in multi-threaded scenarios:**

```
use std::rc::Rc;
use std::sync::Arc;

fn main() {
    let a = Rc::new(5);
    let b = Rc::new(6);

    let c = Rc::new(List {
        value: a.clone(),
        next: Some(b.clone()),
    });

    println!("a = {:p}, b = {:p}", a.as_ptr(), b.as_ptr());
}
```

**7. Use `` `RefCell` `` and `` `Cell` `` for interior mutability:**


    use std::cell::{RefCell, Cell};
    
    fn main() {
      let mut count = RefCell::new (5);
      *count.borrow_mut() += 1;
      println !("count = {:?}", count);
    
      let d = Cell::new (1);
      d.set(2);
      println !("d = {:?}", d.get());
    }


**8. Use `` `std::mem::drop` `` to manually deallocate owned values:**



```
fn main() {

  let s = String::from("hello");
  drop(s);                   // s is dropped here
  println !("s = {:?}", s);  // this will panic
} 
``` 

**9. Use `` `std::ptr::null_mut` `` to create null references:**



```
fn main() {
    let s: *mut i32 = std::ptr::null_mut();
    println!("s = {:?}", s);
}
```

**10. Use `` `std::mem::forget` `` to prevent a value from being dropped:**



```
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");
    std::mem::forget(s);
    println!("s = {:?}", s); // this will not panic
}
```
