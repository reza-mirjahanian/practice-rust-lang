Pattern matching in Rust is a powerful feature that allows you to destructure and match against the structure of data. It is primarily achieved using the `match` statement and the `if let` and `while let` constructs. Here, we'll provide simple examples demonstrating these techniques using both standard and third-party libraries.


**Patterns**Patterns are used to specify the alternatives in a `match` expression. Here are some common patterns:

## 1. Literal Patterns

Literal patterns match a specific value:


```rust
let number = 5;
match number {
    5 => println!("Five"),
    _ => println!("Other"),
}
```

## 2. Wildcard Patterns

Wildcard patterns match any value:


```rust

let number = 5;
match number {
    _ => println!("Any value"),
}
```

## 3. Identifier Patterns

Identifier patterns bind a value to a name:

```rust

let number = 5;
match number {
    x => println!("The value is {}", x),
}
``` 

## 4. Tuple Patterns

Tuple patterns match a tuple value:

```rust

let point = (3, 5);
match point {
    (x, y) => println!("The point is ({}, {})", x, y),
}
```

## 5. Struct Patterns

Struct patterns match a struct value:

```rust

struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}

let point = Point { x: 3, y: 5 };
match point {
    Point { x, y } => println!("The point is ({}, {})", x, y),
}
```

## 6. Enum Patterns

Enum patterns match an enum value:

```rust

enum Color {
    Red,
    Green,
    Blue,
}

let color = Color::Green;
match color {
    Color::Red => println!("The color is red"),
    Color::Green => println!("The color is green"),
    Color::Blue => println!("The color is blue"),
}
```

**Guards**Guards are additional conditions that must be true for a pattern to match:

```rust

let number = 5;
match number {
    x if x > 5 => println!("The value is greater than 5"),
    _ => println!("The value is less than or equal to 5"),
}
``` 

**Bindings**Bindings are used to bind a value to a name:

```rust

let number = 5;
match number {
    x @ 5 => println!("The value is exactly 5"),
    _ => println!("The value is not 5"),
}
``` 

**Third-Party Libraries**Rust has a rich ecosystem of third-party libraries that provide additional pattern matching features. Here are a few examples:

-   **matchit**: A library that provides a more concise and expressive pattern matching syntax.
-   **pat**: A library that provides a set of pattern matching macros for common use cases.

**Example with matchit**Here's an example using the `matchit` library:

```rust

use matchit::matchit;

let number = 5;
matchit!(number => {
    5 => println!("The value is exactly 5"),
    _ => println!("The value is not 5"),
});
```


### Using Standard Library

#### Example with `match`

The `match` statement in Rust allows you to compare a value against a series of patterns and execute code based on which pattern matches.

```rust
fn main() {
    let number = 7;

    match number {
        1 => println!("One!"),
        2 | 3 | 5 | 7 | 11 => println!("This is a prime number"),
        13..=19 => println!("A teen number"),
        _ => println!("Not a special number"),
    }
}

```

In this example:
- `1` matches exactly and prints "One!".
- `2 | 3 | 5 | 7 | 11` uses the `|` operator to match any of these prime numbers and prints a message.
- `13..=19` uses a range pattern to match any teen number.
- `_` is a catch-all pattern that matches any value not covered by the previous patterns.

#### Example with `if let`

The `if let` construct provides a convenient way to match a pattern while ignoring the `else` case.

```rust
fn main() {
    let some_option = Some(42);

    if let Some(value) = some_option {
        println!("Matched value: {}", value);
    } else {
        println!("No match");
    }
}
```

In this example:
- `if let Some(value) = some_option` matches the `Some` variant of the `Option` type and binds the contained value to `value`.

### Using Third-Party Library

#### Example with `regex` crate

Pattern matching can also be applied to text processing using the `regex` crate. First, add the dependency to your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
regex = "1.5"
```

Now, let's use `regex` to match text patterns.

```rust
use regex::Regex;

fn main() {
    let text = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog";

    let re = Regex::new(r"\b\w{5}\b").unwrap();
    for word in re.find_iter(text) {
        println!("Found word: {}", word.as_str());
    }
}
```

In this example:
- `Regex::new` compiles a regular expression that matches words of exactly five letters (`\b\w{5}\b`).
- `re.find_iter(text)` returns an iterator over all matches in the given text.

#### Example with `serde_json` crate

The `serde_json` crate is used for JSON serialization and deserialization, enabling pattern matching on JSON structures. Add the dependency to your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
serde_json = "1.0"
```

Now, let's parse and pattern match on JSON data.

```rust
use serde_json::Value;

fn main() {
    let data = r#"
        {
            "name": "Alice",
            "age": 30,
            "is_student": false
        }
    "#;

    let v: Value = serde_json::from_str(data).unwrap();

    match &v["age"] {
        Value::Number(age) if age.as_i64() == Some(30) => println!("Age is 30"),
        _ => println!("Age is not 30"),
    }

    if let Value::String(name) = &v["name"] {
        println!("Name is {}", name);
    }
}
```

In this example:
- `serde_json::from_str` parses the JSON string into a `serde_json::Value`.
- `match` statement matches on the `age` field and prints a message if it is 30.
- `if let` construct checks if the `name` field is a string and prints it.

### Explanation

1. **Standard Library Examples**:
   - `match` statement allows pattern matching with various patterns (exact, multiple, range, and catch-all).
   - `if let` provides a convenient way to handle optional values and other enums.

2. **Third-Party Library Examples**:
   - `regex` crate for matching text patterns using regular expressions.
   - `serde_json` crate for parsing JSON and matching patterns within JSON structures.

These examples showcase the versatility of pattern matching in Rust, using both standard and third-party libraries to handle different types of data and scenarios.
