WebAssembly (WASM) is a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine. It is designed to be portable and efficient, enabling deployment on the web for client and server applications. Wasmer and Wasmtime are two popular runtimes for executing WASM modules. This guide provides an overview of both runtimes with simple examples using Rust.

### Wasmer

Wasmer is a WebAssembly runtime that can run WASM modules on various platforms, including desktops, servers, and embedded devices. It supports multiple compilation engines and provides a straightforward API.

#### Getting Started with Wasmer

First, add Wasmer to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
wasmer = "3.0"
```

##### Example: Running a Simple WASM Module with Wasmer

```rust
use wasmer::{Store, Module, Instance, Value, imports};

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // Load the WebAssembly binary.
    let wasm_bytes = include_bytes!("simple.wasm");

    // Create a store, module, and instance.
    let store = Store::default();
    let module = Module::new(&store, wasm_bytes)?;
    let import_object = imports! {};
    let instance = Instance::new(&module, &import_object)?;

    // Call the exported function 'add'.
    let add = instance.exports.get_function("add")?;
    let result = add.call(&[Value::I32(2), Value::I32(3)])?;

    println!("Result: {:?}", result[0].i32());

    Ok(())
}
```

In this example:
- A WASM binary is loaded and executed using Wasmer.
- The `add` function from the WASM module is called with parameters `2` and `3`.
- The result is printed to the console.

### Wasmtime

Wasmtime is another popular WebAssembly runtime. It is designed for efficiency and security and is often used in cloud and edge environments.

#### Getting Started with Wasmtime

First, add Wasmtime to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
wasmtime = "6.0"
```

##### Example: Running a Simple WASM Module with Wasmtime

```rust
use wasmtime::*;

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // Load the WebAssembly binary.
    let wasm_bytes = include_bytes!("simple.wasm");

    // Create an engine, store, and module.
    let engine = Engine::default();
    let module = Module::new(&engine, wasm_bytes)?;

    // Create a linker and instantiate the module.
    let mut linker = Linker::new(&engine);
    let instance = linker.instantiate(&module)?;

    // Get the exported function 'add'.
    let add = instance.get_typed_func::<(i32, i32), i32>("add")?;

    // Call the function.
    let result = add.call(2, 3)?;

    println!("Result: {}", result);

    Ok(())
}
```

In this example:
- A WASM binary is loaded and executed using Wasmtime.
- The `add` function from the WASM module is called with parameters `2` and `3`.
- The result is printed to the console.

### Explanation

1. **Wasmer**:
   - **Store**: The context in which WASM modules are compiled and executed.
   - **Module**: A compiled WebAssembly module.
   - **Instance**: An instantiated module with its imports and exports connected.
   - **Imports and Exports**: Mechanisms to connect WASM functions with the host environment.

2. **Wasmtime**:
   - **Engine**: Compiles and manages WebAssembly modules.
   - **Module**: A compiled WebAssembly module.
   - **Linker**: Links modules and their imports.
   - **Instance**: An instantiated module with its imports and exports connected.
   - **Typed Functions**: Safe way to call functions with type checking.
