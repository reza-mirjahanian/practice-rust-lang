### Cargo Audit
Cargo Audit is a command-line utility that helps Rust developers identify vulnerabilities in their project dependencies. It's not part of the standard Rust distribution but is an essential tool for maintaining secure Rust applications.

1. Installation

First, you need to install `cargo audit`:

```sh
cargo install cargo-audit
```

2. Basic Usage

To audit your project for vulnerabilities:

```sh
cargo audit
```

Run this command in your project directory. It will analyze your `Cargo.lock` file and report any known security vulnerabilities in your dependencies.

3. Sample Output

Here's an example of what the output might look like:

```
    Fetching advisory database from `https://github.com/RustSec/advisory-db.git`
      Loaded 392 security advisories (from /home/user/.cargo/advisory-db)
    Scanning Cargo.lock for vulnerabilities (92 crate dependencies)
warning: 1 vulnerability found!
Crate:         smallvec
Version:       1.6.1
Title:         Potential double free in SmallVec::insert_many
Date:          2021-01-26
ID:            RUSTSEC-2021-0003
URL:           https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2021-0003
Solution:      Upgrade to >=1.6.1
Dependency tree: 
smallvec 1.6.1
└── rayon 1.5.0
    └── cargo 0.51.0
```

4. Ignoring Vulnerabilities

Sometimes, you might want to ignore certain vulnerabilities. You can do this by creating a `.cargo/audit.toml` file in your project:

```toml
[[ignore]]
id = "RUSTSEC-2020-0036"
reason = "This vulnerability doesn't affect our usage of the crate"
```

5. Continuous Integration

It's a good practice to include `cargo audit` in your CI pipeline. Here's an example using GitHub Actions:

```yaml
name: Security audit
on:
  push:
    paths: 
      - '**/Cargo.toml'
      - '**/Cargo.lock'
jobs:
  security_audit:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v1
      - uses: actions-rs/audit-check@v1
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

6. Advanced Usage

`cargo audit` offers several command-line options:

```sh
cargo audit --ignore RUSTSEC-2020-0036 # Ignore a specific advisory
cargo audit --db /path/to/advisory-db  # Use a local advisory database
cargo audit --no-fetch                 # Don't fetch the advisory database
cargo audit --format json              # Output results in JSON format
```

7. Using with Third-Party Libraries

`cargo audit` works well with other security-focused tools. For example, you can combine it with `cargo outdated`:

```sh
cargo outdated && cargo audit
```

This checks for both outdated dependencies and security vulnerabilities.

Key points about `cargo audit`:

1. It's an essential tool for maintaining the security of Rust projects.
2. It checks your dependencies against the RustSec Advisory Database.
3. Regular audits are crucial, especially before deploying to production.
4. It can be easily integrated into CI/CD pipelines.
5. The tool provides options for customization and different output formats.

By regularly using `cargo audit`, you can catch and address security vulnerabilities early in your development process, significantly improving the overall security of your Rust applications.
